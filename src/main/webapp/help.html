        <div class="collapse"  ><p>In order to start a presentation on the cloudwall you should first make sure it is swtiched on and functioning properly. Access the power page <a href="../manager/powerStatus.do"  target="_blank"> here</a> (will open link in new tab)</p>
        <br><p class ="text-center">Follow the instruction and you wont get lost! :)</p>
            <p>
            1. Make sure the screens are switched on: look at the <i class="icon-screen "></i> button, if its <span class="text-danger">red</span> click on the button and wait for the screens to turn on, you will see the numbers from 1 to 8 light up. When the button is <span class="text-success">green</span> you can move to the next step.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                2. Once the displays have been powered up, you will want to turn on the computers. Look at the <i class="icon-switch"></i> button, if its <span class="text-success">green</span> you are in luck, the computers are already powered up, move on to the next step. <br> If the <i class="icon-switch"></i> button is <span class="text-danger">red</span> or <span class="text-warning">yellow</span> then you will have to power on the computers, be careful, this can get a little tricky! Click the <i class="icon-switch"></i> button, and wait a few seconds, if it turns <span class="text-success">green</span> you are done, if it is still the same, you will now have to manually power on the computers from the Rechnerraum, dont worry you did not break it, this happens from time to time. 
            </p><br>
            <p>
                3. If you did not have to power on the computers, then you will have to restart them, to make sure they are properly adjusted to all the displays, do this by clicking the <i class=" icon-spinner"></i>, once you have clicked it, the button should go <span class="text-danger">red</span> now you will have to wait till this becomes <span class="text-success">green</span> again, now all the computers are ready. If you have followed all the steps properly you will see the MuVi logo on the well. Congratulations, you are done, now you can do awesomeness.
